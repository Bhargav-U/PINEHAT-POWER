**PineHats** are  versatile shields for the ESP32 microcontroller.They come in multiple versions like,datalogger,buck converter etc.
This PineHat features a onboard 3.3v fixed buck converter circuit,that can deliver currents upto 3Amps. Its stackable design reduces wiring and keeps all GPIO pins accessible.

Ideal for beginners, PineHat combines multiple components into a single, easy-to-use module.


## Features

- **LM2596**:A fixed voltage buck converter that can handle inputs upto 35v delivering a fixed 3.3v at 3Amps. 



## Schematic and Gerber Files

For detailed reference, the schematic and Gerber files for the PCB design are included in the project.
